Java Swing Easy Clipboard Manager

Basically just a set of buttons you can configure to copy things to your clipboard when you click on them. 

Very very basic and minimal

Reads from a file called ```copy.txt```. Each line in the file defines a button. First element is the name on the button, second element is the text to be copied. Separated by a tab (```\t```) delimeter.
